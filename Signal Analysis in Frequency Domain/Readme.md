# Signal Analysis in Frequency Domain Workshop

This lab focuses on signal analysis in the frequency domain using Python. It covers various tasks including Fourier series approximation, understanding Fourier coefficients, comparing ideal and actual filters, and removing power line noise from an ECG signal. Through practical exercises, participants gain insights into signal processing techniques and their applications.

## Tasks Covered:
- **Fourier Series Approximation:** Implement Fourier series approximation for a square wave.
- **Fourier Series Coefficients:** Explore Fourier coefficients and visualize Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coefficients.
- **Ideal Filters and Actual Filters:** Compare ideal and actual filters by simulating filtering operations on sinusoidal waveforms.
- **Removing Power Line Noise in an ECG Signal:** Design a filter to remove power line interference from an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal.
