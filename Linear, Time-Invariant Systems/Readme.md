# Signals-and-Systems-Experiments

This lab, "Linear, Time-Invariant Systems," delves into the analysis of linear, time-invariant systems, aiming to equip students with the ability to analyze continuous and discrete-time systems. It covers topics such as convolution integral and convolution sum, essential concepts in understanding system responses. Participants will utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to implement and visualize these concepts, enabling a hands-on learning experience. The workshop concludes with practical applications in signal filtering, including audio signal processing and image convolution.
